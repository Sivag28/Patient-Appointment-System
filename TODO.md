# Task: Update PatientAppointmentForm.jsx to Match Image UI Arrangement

## Steps:
- [ ] Edit src/PatientAppointmentForm.jsx: Add `col-span-2` to the Nurse field's `<div>` to make it span full width.
- [ ] Verify the layout: Run `npm start` and inspect the form to ensure Nurse field is full-width without affecting other rows.
- [ ] Update TODO.md: Mark steps as completed and finalize.
